# Multiple Blink
On the G2553 the LEDs are P1.0 and P1.6. Both are set to varibles light1 and light2 in the code. Then there's an integer declared to used to count down in the while loop (and also used to count down how many second until my next mental break). The encompassing while loop turns on LED1 every 6000 clock cycles, and off every 6000. The inner while loop toggle LED 2 on and off ever 500 clock cycles.
