# Off Board Blink
## Materials used:
* G2553 IC Chip
* Breadboard
* Power supply
* Wires
* LEDs
* Resistors
* Switch

## How it was built
The IC chip was placed onto the breadboard and then teh circuit was built based off of the IC chip. The top right pin was wired to power, and the top left pin wired to ground. The P1.0 pin was connected to an LED which was in series with a resistor and connected to ground. Same was done at the P1.6 pin. A switch was connected to the reset pin, then connected to ground.
