# Button Blink
This lab programs the processor to blink when a button is pressed.

# How it works (G2553)
P1.0 is set as an output and P1.3 is set as an output. P1.0 is connected to the LED and p1.3 is connected to the button. A pull down resistor is declared and connected to the button. The integer 'number' is declared for some reason which I forget but it's used in a way so that when it equals 0, the LED turns on. My brain is fried. 

# How it works (P401R)
I think my project files for this part of the lab turned out to be crap.
